TO PLAY THE GAME:

In this game, there are 2 characters. The first character is the Player character who resides in the grass. The second character is the enemy. The enemies are bugs
that are crossing the pathway. The object of the game is for the player to cross the pathway and reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies.
If a player collides with an enemy, the game is then reset and the player starts back at where he originated. When the player reaches water, the player has succeeded and won the game.
